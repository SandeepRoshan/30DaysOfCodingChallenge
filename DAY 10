Day 10 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank





The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way.





Day 10 practices,



solve has the following parameters.

=> Given a base-10 integer n, convert it to binary (base-2)

=> Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation.

=> When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

Suggestions are always welcomed.

ANSWER_____________________________


n = int(input().strip())

current_consecutive_1s = 0
max_consecutive_1s = 0
while n > 0:
    remainder = n % 2
    n = n // 2
    if remainder == 1:
        current_consecutive_1s += 1
        if current_consecutive_1s > max_consecutive_1s:
            max_consecutive_1s = current_consecutive_1s
    else:
        current_consecutive_1s = 0

print(max_consecutive_1s)
