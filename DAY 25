Day 25 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank





The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in an effective way.





Day 25 practices,

 

solve has the following parameters.

=> A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1.

=> Given a number, n, determine and print whether it is Prime or Not Prime.

=> the first line contains an integer,T , the number of test cases.

Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for primality.

.

Suggestions are always welcomed.


ANSWER________________________

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    divisor = 2
    while divisor <= n**0.5:
        if n % divisor == 0:
            return False
        divisor += 1

    return True



T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    n=int(input())
    if is_prime(n):
        print('Prime')
    else:
        print('Not prime')
