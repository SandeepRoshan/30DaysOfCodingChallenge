The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in an effective way.


Day 19 practices,
 
solve has the following parameters.
=> Complete the implementation of Calculator class, which implements the AdvancedArithmetic interface. 
=> he implementation for the divisorSum(n) method must return the sum of all divisors of n.

Suggestions are always welcomed.


ANSWER______________________



class Calculator(AdvancedArithmetic):
    def divisorSum(self, n):
         result = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0]
         return sum(result)
