Day 3 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank



The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way.





Day 3 practices,



solve has the following parameters:

=> Given an integer,n, perform the following conditional actions:

=> If n is odd, print Weird.

=> If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird.

=> If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to20, print Weird.

=> If is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird.

ANSWER __________________________________

#!/bin/python3
import sys

N = int(input().strip())
if N % 2==1:
    print('Weird')
elif N < 5:
    print('Not Weird')
elif N <= 20:
    print('Weird')
else:
    print('Not Weird')
