The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in an effective way.


Day 27 practices,
 
solve has the following parameters.
=> For a given array of n integers, the function returns the index of the element with the minimum value in the array. If there is more than one element with the minimum value, it returns the smallest one.
=> If an empty array is passed to the function, it raises an exception. A colleague has written this method. The implementation in Python is listed below. Implementations in other languages can be found in the code template.
