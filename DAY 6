Day 6 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank


The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way.


Day 6 practices,

solve has the following parameters:
=> Given a string, S 
=> of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1,.
=> print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line

ANSWER_____________________

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

N = int(input().strip())
words = []

for _ in range(0, N):
    word = input()
    words.append(word)
    
    
for word in words:
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    
    for i in range(0, len(word)):
        if i%2 == 0:
            s1 += word[i]
        else:
            s2 += word[i]
    print('{} {}'.format(s1,s2))
