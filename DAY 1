Day 1 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank 



I'm glad to share that I started the "30 days coding Challenge". The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way





Day 1 practices,

Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

=>Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.

=>Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.

=>Use the + operator to perform the following operations:

=>Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.

=>Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.

=>Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.



ANSWER:_________________________________________________________________________

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variable
input_int = int(input())
input_double = float(input())
intput_string = str(input())

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i + input_int)

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(round(d + input_double, 1))
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print(s + intput_string)
