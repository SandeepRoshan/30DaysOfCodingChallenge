Day 8 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank


The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way.


Day 8 practices,

solve has the following parameters.
=> The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of entries in the phone book.
=> Each of the n subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an 8-digit phone number.
=> After the n lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a name  to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

n =int(input().strip())
phonebook = {}


for i in range(0, n):
    name, number = input().strip().split(' ')
    phonebook[name] = number;
    
while True:
    try:
        entry = input().strip()
        if entry in phonebook.keys():
            print('{}={}'.format(entry, phonebook[entry]))
        else:
            print('Not found')
    except EOFError:
         break
