Day 2 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank 



I'm glad to share that I started the "30 days coding Challenge". The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way.





Day 2 practices,



solve has the following parameters:

=> int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax

=> int tip_percent: the tip percentage

=> int tax_percent: the tax percentage

=> Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

#!/bin/python3


import sys

#
# Complete the 'solve' function below.
#
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. DOUBLE meal_cost
#  2. INTEGER tip_percent
#  3. INTEGER tax_percent
#

if __name__ == '__main__':
    meal_cost = float(input().strip())

    tip_percent = int(input().strip())

    tax_percent = int(input().strip())
    tip_amount = meal_cost * tip_percent / 100
    tax_amount = meal_cost * tax_percent / 100
    total_cost = round(meal_cost + tip_amount + tax_amount)
    print(str(total_cost))
