Day 16 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank





The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in an effective way.





Day 16 practices,

 

solve has the following parameters.

=> Read a string,S, and print its integer value.

=> if S cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

=> You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a 0 score.
