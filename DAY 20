Day 20 of hashtag#30dayscodingchallenge hashtag#hackerrank


The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in an effective way.


Day 20 practices,
 
solve has the following parameters.
=> Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
=> First Element: firstElement.
=> Last Element: lastElement.
=> you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Suggestions are always welcomed.

ANSWER__________________________

def bubble_sort(arr:list) -> int:
    swap_cnt = 0

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)-1):
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]):
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

                swap_cnt += 1
        
        if swap_cnt == 0:
            break
    return swap_cnt

print('Array is sorted in {swap_cnt} swaps.'.format(swap_cnt=bubble_sort(a)))
print('First Element: {}'.format(a[0]))
print('Last Element: {}'.format(a[-1]))
