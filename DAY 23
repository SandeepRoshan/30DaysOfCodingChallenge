Day 23 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank





The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in an effective way.





Day 23 practices,

 

solve has the following parameters.

=> The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a BST.

=> The first line contains an integer,T (the number of test cases).

=> The T subsequent lines each contain an integer,data, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

ANSWER_______________________________


class Solution{

    static void levelOrder(Node root){
    //Write your code here
      Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>();
      queue.add(root);
      while(queue.peek()!=null)
          {
          Node node =queue.remove();
          System.out.print(""+node.data+" ");
          if(node.left!=null)
              queue.add(node.left);
          if(node.right!=null)
              queue.add(node.right);
      }
  }
