Day 15 of hashtag#30dayscodingchallenge hashtag#hackerrank


The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in an effective way.


Day 15 practices,

solve has the following parameters.
=> Complete the insert function in your editor so that it creates a new Node (pass data as the Node constructor argument) 
=> inserts it at the tail of the linked list referenced by the head parameter
=> Once the new node is added, return the reference to the head node.

Suggestions are always welcomed.

ANSWER_________________

      //Complete this method
    if(head == null){
            return new Node(data);
        }
        
        // else iterate through list, add node to tail, and return head
        Node tmp = head;
        while(tmp.next != null){
            tmp = tmp.next;
        }
        tmp.next = new Node(data);
            
        return head;
    }
