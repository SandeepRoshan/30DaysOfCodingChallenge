Day 14 of hashtag#30dayscodingchallenge hashtag#hackerrank


The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way.


Day 14 practices,

solve has the following parameters.
=> A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the ___elements instance variable.
=> A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in ____elements.
=> stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
.

.
Suggestions are always welcomed.


ANSWER___________________

class Difference {
  	private int[] elements;
  	public int maximumDifference;

    public Difference(int[] elements){
        this.elements = elements;
    }

    public void computeDifference(){
        Arrays.sort(elements);
        this.maximumDifference = Math.abs(elements[elements.length - 1] - elements[0]);
    }
} // End of Difference class
