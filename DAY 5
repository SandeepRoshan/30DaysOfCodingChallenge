Day 5 of #30dayscodingchallenge #hackerrank

The 30 Days Challenge is a highly effective way to learn problem solving skills and it will help me to develop my coding knowledge in a effective way.


Day 5 practices,

solve has the following parameters:
=> Given an integer.
=> n print its first 10 multiples.
=> Each multiple n x i (where 1<= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line
=> In the form: n x i = result.

ANSWER__________________________________

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n;
    int i;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
    {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n",n,i,n*i);
    }   
}
